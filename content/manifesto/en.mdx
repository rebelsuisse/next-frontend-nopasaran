## For a cordon sanitaire around the far right

Far-right parties, led by the Swiss People's Party (SVP) in Switzerland, are not like other parties.
Racism, homophobia, sexism, and repeated lies are not isolated incidents, but are systemic.
Members of far-right parties and movements constantly flirt with the limits of anti-discrimination laws. 
Their rhetoric is not without consequence. It contributes directly to the rise of fascism, legitimizes aggression, and poisons public debate.

### Freedom of opinion and freedom of expression
Members of the Swiss People's Party deliberately confuse freedom of opinion with freedom of expression to justify the unacceptable.
Let us recall a fundamental principle: freedom of opinion, which is and must remain a pillar of our democracy, protects the right to think.
But freedom of expression ends where incitement to hatred, insults, lies, and violence begin.
- Racism is not an opinion, it is a crime.
- Denying the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians is not an opinion, it is denial.
- Doubting global warming is not an opinion, it is denying science.
- Saying that all people receiving state financial assistance are freeloaders is not an opinion, it is a lie.
- Discrimination against homosexuals is not an opinion, it is a crime.
- Considering women inferior to men or justifying inequalities is not an opinion, it is sexism.

### Our Appeal

1.  **The urgency of a cordon sanitaire**
We call on all political forces, civil society organizations,
the media, and citizens to form a cordon sanitaire around the UDC and all far-right movements. This means refusing any political alliance,
    no longer considering their proposals as an acceptable basis for discussion, rejecting openly racist poster campaigns,
    and systematically denouncing their hate speech.
    This is the bare minimum required to protect our democracy from the rise of fascism.
2.  **The responsibility of the media**
Every microphone held out without contradiction, every television appearance offered without critical analysis,
is a platform for hatred and active participation in the spread of fascism. We call on journalists and the media to take responsibility.
Reporting on the far right must never again mean offering it a platform for propaganda.

In light of the hundreds of documented incidents, the very place of these parties in the democratic spectrum must be questioned.
Does a party that so systematically contravenes the fundamental values of our society still have a place?
