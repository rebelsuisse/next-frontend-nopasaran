# Thank you

The far right slips up on an almost daily basis.

Feeding the [nopasaran.ch](https://nopasaran.ch) database is therefore a significant undertaking. This is only possible thanks to the commitment of several activists who generously devote part of their time to the cause.

* I would like to express my deep gratitude to the Discord server community of **Eteicos Corp**, which is where most of the site's contributors come from.
* We would also like to acknowledge the work of journalist **Mirjam Kohler**, who has documented more than [350 incidents](https://flimmer.media/a/einzelfaelle) involving members of the SVP.
